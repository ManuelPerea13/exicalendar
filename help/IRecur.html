            <td class="description last">Indicates a string that represents the recurrence-expression to parse, or an object of {dtstart, freq, until, count, interval, bysecond, byminute, byhour, byday, bymonthday, byyearday, byweekno, bymonth, bysetpos, wkst} type. The expression may include any of the following fields:<ul> <li>FREQ, {string} The FREQ rule part identifies the type of recurrence rule. This rule part MUST be specified in the recurrence rule. Valid values include SECONDLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a second or more; MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a week or more; MONTHLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a month or more; and YEARLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a year or more. The valid values are "SECONDLY", "MINUTELY", "HOURLY", "DAILY", "WEEKLY", "MONTHLY" and "YEARLY". <li>DTSTART {Date}, The DTSTART rule specifies the date the recurrence starts from, in YYYYMMDD[THHNNSS[Z]] format. If missing the current date and time is used. <li>INTERVAL {number}, The INTERVAL rule part contains a positive integer representing at which intervals the recurrence rule repeats. The default value is "1", meaning every second for a SECONDLY rule, every minute for a MINUTELY rule, every hour for an HOURLY rule, every day for a DAILY rule, every week for a WEEKLY rule, every month for a MONTHLY rule, and every year for a YEARLY rule.  For example, within a DAILY rule, a value of "8" means every eight days. <li>COUNT {number}, The COUNT rule part defines the number of occurrences at which to range-bound the recurrence. The "DTSTART" property value always counts as the first occurrence. <li>WKST {string}, The WKST rule part specifies the day on which the workweek starts. Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, and SU.  This is significant when a WEEKLY "RRULE" has an interval greater than 1, and a BYDAY rule part is specified.  This is also significant when in a YEARLY "RRULE" when a BYWEEKNO rule part is specified. The default value is MO. <li>UNTIL {Date}, The UNTIL rule part defines a DATE or DATE-TIME value that bounds the recurrence rule in an inclusive manner.  If the value specified by UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence, this DATE or DATE-TIME becomes the last instance of the recurrence.  The value of the UNTIL rule part MUST have the same value type as the "DTSTART" property. <li>BYWEEKNO {string}, The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of ordinals specifying weeks of the year. Valid values are 1 to 53 or -53 to -1. <li>BYDAY {string}, The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the week; SU indicates Sunday; MO indicates Monday; TU indicates Tuesday; WE indicates Wednesday; TH indicates Thursday; FR indicates Friday; and SA indicates Saturday. <li>BYMONTHDAY {string}, The BYMONTHDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the month. Valid values are 1 to 31 or -31 to -1. For example, -10 represents the tenth to the last day of the month. The BYMONTHDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified when the FREQ rule part is set to WEEKLY. <li>BYYEARDAY {string}, The BYYEARDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the year. Valid values are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1. For example, -1 represents the last day of the year (December 31st) and -306 represents the 306th to the last day of the year (March 1st).  The BYYEARDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified when the FREQ rule part is set to DAILY, WEEKLY, or MONTHLY. <li>BYSETPOS {string}, The BYSETPOS rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of values that corresponds to the nth occurrence within the set of recurrence instances specified by the rule.  BYSETPOS operates on a set of recurrence instances in one interval of the recurrence rule. For example, in a WEEKLY rule, the interval would be one week A set of recurrence instances starts at the beginning of the interval defined by the FREQ rule part.  Valid values are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1.  It MUST only be used in conjunction with another BYxxx rule part.  For example "the last work day of the month" could be represented as: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1 Each BYSETPOS value can include a positive (+n) or negative (-n) integer.  If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the specific occurrence within the set of occurrences specified by the rule. <li>BYMONTH {string}, The BYMONTH rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of months of the year.  Valid values are 1 to 12. <li>BYHOUR {string}, The BYHOUR rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of hours of the day.  Valid values are 0 to 23. <li>BYMINUTE {string}, The BYMINUTE rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of minutes within an hour. Valid values are 0 to 59. <li>BYSECOND {string}, The BYSECOND rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of seconds within a minute. Valid values are 0 to 60.</ul></td>

            <td class="description last">Indicates the name of the rule to request. The rule can be aby of the following:<ul> <li>FREQ, {string} The FREQ rule part identifies the type of recurrence rule. This rule part MUST be specified in the recurrence rule. Valid values include SECONDLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a second or more; MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a week or more; MONTHLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a month or more; and YEARLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a year or more. The valid values are "SECONDLY", "MINUTELY", "HOURLY", "DAILY", "WEEKLY", "MONTHLY" and "YEARLY". <li>DTSTART {Date}, The DTSTART rule specifies the date the recurrence starts from, in YYYYMMDD[THHNNSS[Z]] format. If missing the current date and time is used. <li>INTERVAL {number}, The INTERVAL rule part contains a positive integer representing at which intervals the recurrence rule repeats. The default value is "1", meaning every second for a SECONDLY rule, every minute for a MINUTELY rule, every hour for an HOURLY rule, every day for a DAILY rule, every week for a WEEKLY rule, every month for a MONTHLY rule, and every year for a YEARLY rule.  For example, within a DAILY rule, a value of "8" means every eight days. <li>COUNT {number}, The COUNT rule part defines the number of occurrences at which to range-bound the recurrence. The "DTSTART" property value always counts as the first occurrence. <li>WKST {string}, The WKST rule part specifies the day on which the workweek starts. Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, and SU.  This is significant when a WEEKLY "RRULE" has an interval greater than 1, and a BYDAY rule part is specified.  This is also significant when in a YEARLY "RRULE" when a BYWEEKNO rule part is specified. The default value is MO. <li>UNTIL {Date}, The UNTIL rule part defines a DATE or DATE-TIME value that bounds the recurrence rule in an inclusive manner.  If the value specified by UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence, this DATE or DATE-TIME becomes the last instance of the recurrence.  The value of the UNTIL rule part MUST have the same value type as the "DTSTART" property. <li>BYWEEKNO {string}, The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of ordinals specifying weeks of the year. Valid values are 1 to 53 or -53 to -1. <li>BYDAY {string}, The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the week; SU indicates Sunday; MO indicates Monday; TU indicates Tuesday; WE indicates Wednesday; TH indicates Thursday; FR indicates Friday; and SA indicates Saturday. <li>BYMONTHDAY {string}, The BYMONTHDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the month. Valid values are 1 to 31 or -31 to -1. For example, -10 represents the tenth to the last day of the month. The BYMONTHDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified when the FREQ rule part is set to WEEKLY. <li>BYYEARDAY {string}, The BYYEARDAY rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of days of the year. Valid values are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1. For example, -1 represents the last day of the year (December 31st) and -306 represents the 306th to the last day of the year (March 1st).  The BYYEARDAY rule part MUST NOT be specified when the FREQ rule part is set to DAILY, WEEKLY, or MONTHLY. <li>BYSETPOS {string}, The BYSETPOS rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of values that corresponds to the nth occurrence within the set of recurrence instances specified by the rule.  BYSETPOS operates on a set of recurrence instances in one interval of the recurrence rule. For example, in a WEEKLY rule, the interval would be one week A set of recurrence instances starts at the beginning of the interval defined by the FREQ rule part.  Valid values are 1 to 366 or -366 to -1.  It MUST only be used in conjunction with another BYxxx rule part.  For example "the last work day of the month" could be represented as: FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1 Each BYSETPOS value can include a positive (+n) or negative (-n) integer.  If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the specific occurrence within the set of occurrences specified by the rule. <li>BYMONTH {string}, The BYMONTH rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of months of the year.  Valid values are 1 to 12. <li>BYHOUR {string}, The BYHOUR rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of hours of the day.  Valid values are 0 to 23. <li>BYMINUTE {string}, The BYMINUTE rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of minutes within an hour. Valid values are 0 to 59. <li>BYSECOND {string}, The BYSECOND rule part specifies a COMMA-separated list of seconds within a minute. Valid values are 0 to 60.</ul></td>
